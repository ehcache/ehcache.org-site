Meet our team and join our sessions at the following conferences and meetups.

### Devoxx Morocco : November 16-18, 2015 : Casablanca, Morocco
[Louis Jacomet](http://cfp.devoxx.ma/2015/talk/FDX-7262/Ehcache3:_JSR107_on_steroids) speaks about _Ehcache3: JSR-107 on Steroids_

JSR107, aka the Temporary Caching API for the Java Platform, has now been finalized almost 2 years ago. We've heard all about its ease of use and capabilities. But there is much left unaddressed. The good news is that the EG is looking at addressing many of the current shortcomings. [...]

Session on Wednesday November 18th at 11am - Full description on the Devoxx Morocco website

### Devoxx : November 9-13, 2015 : Antwerp, Belgium

[Alex Snaps and Louis Jacomet](http://cfp.devoxx.be/2015/talk/KVW-1306/Caching_101:_Caching_on_the_JVM_(and_beyond)) speak about _Caching 101: Caching on the JVM (and beyond)_

After numerous presentation on the JSR107, this in-depth 3 hour university session will twist the problem upside down. Instead of leading you through every aspect of the new Caching API for Java, we'll start from a real Java application, looking at its architecture, measure contention points and slowly start adding different caching patterns to it. [...]

Session on Monday November 9th at 1.30pm - Full description on the Devoxx website

[Chris Dennis](http://cfp.devoxx.be/2015/talk/AYH-2795/Terracotta%E2%80%99s_OffHeap_Explained) speaks about _Terracotta's OffHeap Explained_

Terracotta open sourced it’s core offheap library earlier this year. [...] What follows will be an explanation of how well understood CS concepts from managed and unmanaged programing environments combine to produce a stable, reliable, and useful library.

## Recent Events

### JavaOne : October 25-29, 2015 : San Francisco, CA
[Alex Snaps](https://events.rainfocus.com/oow15/catalog/oracle.jsp?event=javaone&search=snaps&search.event=javaoneEvent) spoke about _Ehcache3:JSR 107 on Steroids [CON10204]_

As the EG is looking at addressing the current shortcomings of JSR 107 with a future JCache 2.0 API, what can you do now to address your advanced caching use cases? Go for proprietary APIs? The brand new Ehcache3, besides ease of use, was crafted with that exact goal in mind: looking beyond the current spec. With close to no API tie-ins, Ehcache3 enables you to extend the JSR 107 API transparently. Whether you want to go off-heap and scale up; scale out by clustering your caches; or require transactions, automatic resource control, or scaling out of writes with write-behind, everything is available to you through a couple of configuration tweaks. Not only minimally intrusive but also available for free today in the open source Ehcache v3.

[Chris Dennis along with Brian Oliver (Architect, Oracle)](https://events.rainfocus.com/oow15/catalog/oracle.jsp?event=javaone&search=dennis&search.event=javaoneEvent) hosted _Birds of a Feather Session – JCache 2.0: Where Do We Go from Here? [BOF6835]_

The Java caching standard (JSR 107) was finally released in 2014, after 13 years of on-and-off work. The caching community has already started to move on, however. There is already discussion of what is missing from the current standard and what could or should be included in JCache 2.0. The JSR 107 specification leads and expert group members would like to engage the community in an open discussion of JCache 2.0. What important features are missing from JSR 107? What use cases should a future JCache 2.0 support? What features would be required to support those use cases? Attend this BOF session, get your voice heard, and engage directly with the rest of the caching community to help define the genesis of a JCache 2.0 standard.

### Open Source Seminar on Ehcache : October 17, 2015 : Bangalore, India

Great opportunity to hear directly from the architects and developers of Ehcache.
Learn about exciting new offerings, JSR107 and the roadmap ahead.

You can also use this occasion to meet and directly talk about your use cases with them and also get to know how you can become part of the large open source ecosystem around Ehcache.

### SpringOne 2GX : September 14-17, 2015: Washington, DC
[Alex Snaps and Chris Dennis](https://2015.event.springone2gx.com/schedule/sessions/bringing_javax_cache_ing_to_your_application.html) spoke about _Bringing javax.cache’ing to your application_

The [recording is available](http://spring.io/blog/2015/10/19/springone2gx-2015-replay-bringing-javax-cache-ing-to-your-application) for replay thanks to the Spring website.
