A cache put will cause a CacheWriter write <br>* and a cache remove will cause a writer delete. <br>* &lt;p&gt; <br>* Implementers should create an implementation which handles storing and <br>* deleting to an underlying resource. <br>* &lt;/p&gt; <br>* &lt;h4&gt;Write-Through&lt;/h4&gt; <br>* In write-through mode, the cache operation will occur and the writer <br>* operation will occur before CacheEventListeners are notified. If the <br>* write operation fails an exception will be thrown. This can result in <br>* a cache which is inconsistent with the underlying resource. <br>* To avoid this, the cache and the underlying resource should be configured <br>* to participate in a transaction. In the event of a failure, <br>* a rollback can return all components to a consistent state. <br>* &lt;p/&gt; <br>* &lt;h4&gt;Write-Behind&lt;/h4&gt; <br>* In write-behind mode, writes are written to a write-behind queue. They are <br>* written by a separate execution thread in a configurable <br>* way.
